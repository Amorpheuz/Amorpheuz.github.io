Hey everyone! I would love to share my journey throughout Hacktoberfest with you all. Here is how my week 1 went.

While browsing through dev the week before Hacktobest began, I noticed certain links broken in a few articles. I had already started contributing to dev.to's repo, albeit small-time, and thus was fully aware of how bug reporting worked. Off I went to GitHub and opened  [Links in Comments get appended by dev.to's URL #4101](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/issues/4101)!

One of the contributors to the repo, [Akshay Mahajan](https://dev.to/_akshaym), pointed out that it might be due to the `href` attribute of `a` tag missing the `http://` or `https://` protocol. I did some searching of my own after the hint which led to me finding out that the `href` tag needs to have the protocol defined for it to know that it is a separate link and not a relative path to a file on the server. 

Time to figure out what causes this kind of link to appear in the `href` tag. I loaded up my development repo on VS-Code and entered in a simple link:
`[Test](google.com)` 

Aha! I had managed to replicate the issue. The markdown parser did not account for whether the http(s) protocol was passed along with the URL or not. I grabbed the issue as something I would like to tackle and moved ahead onto figuring out a solution.

The technical overview is the place to start whenever contributing to dev, it provides a complete picture of all the technologies that power it and enables any contributor to know exactly what they are looking in the massive repo. I found out that [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) and [Rouge](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge) empower markdown parsing. A basic overview of RedCarpet's readme allowed me to figure out what exactly I should be looking out for.

Turns out there was already a file that was performing another task on the links and I had to just add my logic to the same. I decided that regex was the way to go for detecting if the link contained http(s) or not. I pulled up my favorite tool for regex, [Regex101](https://regex101.com/), switched to the unit testing mode and started formulating the regex. 

The initial solution I came up with was `/^(http(s*):\/\/)/m`. It seemed to pass all the tests and I happily opened a [PR](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/pull/4155)!

Turns out my familiarity with Regex is still beginner tier, and there are a lot of subtleties involved when working with regex. [Rhymes](https://dev.to/rhymes), one of the core team members, pointed out various flaws which I happily formulated a fix for. He also requested me to configure tests for the same. 

Here's where I hit a roadblock, I am still learning ruby and have never written a test in any other language I am familiar with throughout my development career (I swear this is the year that changes). I also had my university exams (Ongoing as I write this post) which were going to last for the better half of the month. I notified about the same on the PR and since it was a core feature of dev that the fix was affecting, Rhymes requested whether one of the core contributors would see the PR to completion.

[Mac](https://dev.to/maestromac) came to my PR's rescue and carried it all the way to completion along with Rhymes and I am happy to report that the PR has been successfully merged. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

I am extremely satisfied to have such an adventurous first week in Hactoberfest and finally being able to contribute at a core functionality level (although partially) from the minor CSS fixes here and there.

Once again, thank you to all the people that helped me throughout my first week and a ton of thanks to all of them:
- [Akshay Mahajan](https://dev.to/_akshaym)
- [Rhymes](https://dev.to/rhymes)
- [Mac Siri](https://dev.to/maestromac)
