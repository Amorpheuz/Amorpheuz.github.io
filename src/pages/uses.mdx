# fetchDailyUsedItems

This page lists everything that I use in my day to day life as a developer. I primarily use a Windows + Manjaro machine, 
but most of the Software listed here is Windows specific! Manjaro has stuff I like built-in except the cross-platform stuff listed below.
If you are inspired to make your own `/uses` page, consider 
adding it to [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos)!
