# WhoAmI

Hey everyone! I am Yash Dave, a Passionate and Self-Motivated Developer that loves working with Open-Source Technologies and Contributing to them!

I have helped contribute to DEV Community, Mozilla India, and Mozilla Gujarat. I'm experienced in working with React.js, ASP.NET Core and Python and have built or contributed to various projects based on them. Apart from that, I am currently learning Data Science at my university along with self-pacing some concepts. I am also currently intrigued by Blockchain & Smart Contracts and the possibilities they can help realize.

I love to be on the experimental cutting edge and dabbling into new technologies. I love mentoring folks newer to the field than myself and motivating others to contribute to Open Source.
