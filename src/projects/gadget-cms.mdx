My aim is to build a server-side Content Management system specifically tailored to managing content related to Electronic products such as smartphones, smart-watches, etc. It is built upon the modern ASP.NET Core framework based on Razor page model. The system is called “GadgetCMS” which falls under “Web Content Management (WCM)” system.
